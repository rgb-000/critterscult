        "Critters Cult is an indie experiment in art and narrative, developed by Sun Studio (Suns), under the same nostalgic spirit that drives all @rgb0x00 pixel-art creations. It's a zero utility collection focused on building a community through high quality art & aesthetics. The first part of the project will be the launch of the profile picture (or characters) collection. The second phase will be the lore (or narrative) development through a Reigns-like web application and also through derivative artworks to be auctioned or aidropped in the following months. The third phase will be the expansion through the landscape (or scenario) collection, Sunsets:Saga to be launched next year",

Critters Cult has the ambition to be world-building-like fiction work, in the sense to evolve in a coherent hypothetical setting with its own logic and physical rules.",
